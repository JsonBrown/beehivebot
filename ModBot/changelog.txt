-------v1.01

Fixed "!raffle open" output to say <currency> instead of tokens.
Can now open raffles with 0 ticket cost.  Command is still the same.  Ex: !raffle open 0 1 would be a raffle where everyone in the channel can buy 1 ticket and it doesn't cost them any coins.
"!raffle close" and "!raffle draw" now have an optional third parameter where you can specify how many people to draw.  Ex:  "!raffle close 3" will draw 3 winners.  "!raffle close" by itself will still draw 1 winner.
Custom commands now handle "@user" in them in the same way that greetings do.  For instance, if you did "!mod addcommand 0 !hello Hello, @user.", then someone in your channel named Keirathi typed "!hello", the bot would reply with "Hello, Keirathi."
Added About button to the startup GUI.
Added tooltips to startup GUI.
The channel admin can now type !<currency> <user> to check a specific user's amount of currency.
Added reconnecting to the channel after disconnects.
Removed some superfluous error messages from showing up in the console window/Error_Log.log
Fixed a bug in the !ticket command that wouldn't allow you to buy your max amount of <currency> worth of tickets
